**Question 1**
Antibiotics are commonly using to treat sinus infections. Alternatively a steroid solution can be sprayed into the nose. In a trial, 50 children with a sinus infection were randomly assigned to receive an antibiotic tablet or a steroid nasal spray. The severity and length of the sinus infection was recorded for the children after 2 weeks.

All children with a sinus infection are best described as:

- [ ] a parameter
- [ ] a sample
- [ ] a response variable
- [x] the target population
- [ ] a statistic

The average length of the sinus infection for the children in the study is best described as a: (1 mark)

- [ ] variable
- [ ] parameter
- [x] summary statistic
- [ ] sample
- [ ] none of the above



**Question 2**
Suppose that information recorded for students studying a particular subject in Trimester 1 includes student ID, name, gender, post code, mobile phone number, course enrolled in, campus of enrolment, distance travelled to university
and numerical assignment marks.
Which of the following best describes "why"?

- [x] For record keeping
- [ ] To determine whether people living at home with their parents travel greater distances to university
- [ ] To determine whether ethnicity has an impact on university marks
- [ ] To compare different styles of assessment
- [ ] To see which university has the highest achieving students



**Question 3**
Suppose that information recorded for students studying a particular subject in Trimester 1 includes student ID, name, gender, post code, mobile phone number, course enrolled in, campus of enrolment, distance travelled to university
and numerical assignment marks.

Which of the following best describes "Who"?

- [ ] Student ID
- [x] Students studying a particular subject
- [ ] Lecturer
- [ ] Name
- [ ] A university



**Question 4**
Suppose that information recorded for fish caught along a section of coast consists of the location name, species, weight, length, gender, water temperature and the season.
Which of the following have been included in the information recorded and should be treated as categorical variables?

- [x] species
- [x] gender
- [ ] weight
- [ ] water temperature
- [ ] length
- [x] season
- [x] location
- [ ] fish colour



**Question 5**
Suppose that information recorded for fish caught along a section of coast consists of the location name, species, weight, length, gender, water temperature and the season.
Which of the following have been included in the information recorded and should be treated as numerical variables?

- [ ] water salinity

- [x] weight

- [ ] season

- [ ] species

- [x] length

- [ ] gender

- [ ] location coordinates

- [ ] air temperature

  > You need to select data that is both numerical, **and** is included in the variables listed so be sure to read carefully.



**Question 6**
Information recorded for patients included name, gender, blood pressure, weight, height, age (in years), number of children, and diabetes risk (low, moderate or high).

Match the variable to the correct data type.

| Variable           | Data Type              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Diabetes Risk      | Categorical (ordinal)  |
| Height             | Numerical (continuous) |
| Gender             | Categorical (nominal)  |
| Number of Children | Numerical (discrete)   |



**Question 7**

Blood Pressure

A company held a blood pressure screening clinic for its employees.  The results are summarised in the table below by age group and blood pressure level:



| Blood Pressure | $< 30$ | $30 - 49$ | *$\ge 50$* | Total   |
| -------------- | ------ | --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| **Low**        | 82     | 18        | 42         | 142     |
| **Mid**        | 59     | 42        | 34         | 135     |
| **High**       | 47     | 82        | 60         | 189     |
| **Total**      | 188    | 142       | 136        | **466** |



What percentage of the companyâ€™s employees are aged 30-49?

**Answer:** $\frac{142}{466} \times 100 = 30.5$
