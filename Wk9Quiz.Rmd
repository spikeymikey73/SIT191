**Question 1**

Jimmy wants to test the performance of two different pairs of shoes on his running times. Each time he runs, he flips a coin to determine which pair of shoes he's going to wear and then measures the time (in minutes) it takes him to run 10km. He ran wearing Pair 1 on 11 occasions (mean of 42:03, standard deviation of 3:16) and Pair 2 on 13 occasions (mean of 40:29, standard deviation of 4:23). 

What is the value for the **degrees of freedom** (using $n_1 + n_2 - 2$)?

```{r}
  Pair1 <- 11
  Pair2 <- 13
  df <- Pair1 + Pair2 - 2
  print(df)
```

**Question 2**

Hand span is defined as the maximum distance between the tips of the thumb and little finger. Hand span (cm) was compared for a random sample of 87 boys and 103 girls of the same age. From the results, a 95% confidence interval for the average difference (boys - girls) in hand span between the genders was calculated as 2.06 to 2.98cm.

Choose the most correct interpretation of the interval.

- [x]   We can be 95% confident that average hand span for boys is between 2.06 and 2.98cm larger than the average hand span for girls.
- [ ]   We can be 95% confident that average hand span for girls is between 2.06 and 2.98cm larger than the average hand span for boys.
- [ ]   The average hand span for all boys is between 2.06 smaller and 2.98cm larger than the average hand span for all girls.
- [ ]   We can be 95% confident that average hand span for boys is between 2.06 and 2.98cm.
- [ ]   We can be 95% confident that average hand span for girls is between 2.06 and 2.98cm.

**Question 3**

A researcher wanted to compare whether language makes a difference in recalling sequences of numbers. Each test involved briefly displaying a random sequence of digits and then asking the participant to recall as much of the sequence as they could. The data collected for a sample of English speakers and a sample of Chinese speakers were as follows.  The means given are the average number of digits that could be remembered from the sequence.
 
```{r}
  knitr::kable(Q3, "pipe")
```

Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference (English score - Chinese score) in average recall for English and Chinese speakers and choose the correct answer.
Use $df = n_1 + n_2 - 2$.

- [ ]   $-1.85$ to $2.38$
- [ ]   $-1.96$ to $-0.16$
- [ ]   $7.12$ to $8.18$
- [x]   $-2.14$ to $0.02$
- [ ]   $1.339$ to $2.507$

> The confidence interval formula is:
>
> $(\bar{x}_1 − \bar{x}_2) \pm t^*_{df} \times \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$
>
> $df = 36 + 26 - 2 = 60$.
>
>The critical $t-value$ is $2.00$ (reading from the t-table based on a 95% confidence interval).

**Question 4**

```{r}
  knitr::kable(Q5, "pipe")
  
```

If conducting a hypothesis test to see whether the average completion time is significantly different for male and female rats, what is the magnitude of t, the test statistic?

[If you have a negative value then just choose the correct magnitude - i.e. the value as a positive number]

- [x]   1.93
- [ ]   0.59
- [ ]   2.57
- [ ]   0.10
- [ ]   1.82

**Question 10**

A hypothesis test to test if one mean is greater than the other (1-tailed probability) was conducted, with $n_1 = 24$ and $n_2 = 26$ and  

$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 − \bar{x}_2 − 0}{SE(\bar{x}_1 − \bar{x}_2)} = 1.27$

Select the correct P-value range, using $df = n_1 + n_2 -2$.

- [ ]   $P-value > 0.01$
- [ ]   $P-value > 0.2$
- [ ]   $0.05 < P-value<0.1$
- [x]   $P-value > 0.1$
- [ ]   $P-value < 0.05$

**Question 11**

An experiment was conducted to test the ability of rats to navigate a maze, as measured by the time it takes rats to find food at the end of the maze.
The average maze completion time (in minutes) for 25 male rats was 64.2 minutes and for 28 female rats the average completion time was 59.4 minutes
Is the difference in mean completion times significant?
Using a calculated test statistic value of $t = 4.72$ and $P-value < 0.010$, choose the most correct conclusion (use $\alpha = 0.05$).

- [ ]   Fail to reject $H_0$ since $P-value < 0.05$ – there is evidence that the mean completion time for male rats is longer than that for females
- [ ]   Reject $H_a$ since $P-value < 0.05$ – there is insufficient evidence that the mean completion time for male and female rats is different
- [x]   Reject $H_0$ since the $P-value < 0.05$ – there appears to be a significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats
- [ ]   Reject $H_0$ since $P-value > 0.05$ – there appears to be no significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats
- [ ]   Fail to reject $H_0 since P-value > 0.05$ – there appears to be no significant difference in the mean completion time for male and female rats

**Question 12**

The average hours of pain relief provided by five different pain relief drugs are to be compared. Patients with post-surgery pain were randomly assigned to one of the drugs and the number of hours of pain relief recorded. Ten patients were assigned to take each drug.
Choose the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses.

- [ ]   $H_a: \mu1 \ne \mu2 \ne \mu3 \ne \mu4 \ne \mu5$ (all five of the groups' averages differ)
- [x]   $H_a$: At least 2 of the drugs provide significantly different average pain relief
- [x]   $H_0: \mu1 = \mu2 = \mu3 = \mu4 = \mu5$ (all drugs have the same average pain relief)
- [ ]   $H_0$: The average pain relief for drug 1 is significantly lower than all other drugs.

**Question 15**

An experiment involved hand washing with four different soaps to see what effect the soaps might have on bacteria colonies.
The ANOVA table is shown below.

![ANOVA Data](/Users/malford/Documents/BPscyhSci/SIT191/Images/Wk9Images/Q15_img.png)

What are the conclusions you can reach based on the test (use $\alpha = 0.05$)?

[Select all that apply]

- [x]   There are no statistically significant differences between mean bacteria colonies for any of the soaps.
- [x]   Since $p-value > \alpha$, we fail to reject $H_0$.
- [ ]   The average bacteria colonies between at least two of the soaps are significantly different.
- [ ]   Since $p-value < \alpha$, we reject $H_0$.
- [x]   It would be appropriate to perform Bonferroni multiple comparisons to determine which soaps result in significantly different mean bacteria colonies.

**Question 16**

Random samples of students from three different prac groups were selected, and their scores for an assessment task (out of 80) recorded.

- [ ]   The mean for group 3 is significantly higher than the mean for group 1, which is significantly higher than the mean for group 2.
- [ ]   The mean for group 1 is significantly higher than the mean for group 2.
- [ ]   All of the groups' means are significantly different to each other.
