**Question 5**

(enter correct to the nearest **whole number**, e.g. 26)

**Answer:**  _81_

```

**Question 6**

In a particular rural area of Victoria, 52% of learner drivers pass their driving test on the first attempt.

**If 6 learner drivers are selected, what is the probability of a successful driving test outcome for all 6 drivers (on their first attempts)?**

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** 0.020
$$
  p^n = {n \choose n}p^n(1-p)^0\\
      = {6 \choose 6}0.52^6(1 - 0.52)^0\\
      = 1 \times 0.019770609 \times 1\\
$$
```R
> round(dbinom(6, size=6, prob=0.52), 3)
[1] 0.02
```



**Question 7**

Suppose 70% of the population have brown eyes, 15% have blue eyes, 6% have hazel eyes, 7% have green eyes and the rest 'other' (including grey).

Among 7 randomly selected people, what is the probability that exactly 4 people have blue eyes?

- [ ] 0.001
- [ ] 0.6
- [x] 0.011
- [ ] 3.11
- [ ] 0.227

```R
> round(dbinom(4, size=7, prob=0.15), 3)
[1] 0.011
```



**Question 8**

Suppose 72% of adults have travelled overseas.

**If 6 adults are randomly selected, what is the probability that 3 or 4 of them have travelled overseas?**

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** *0.480*

```R
> round(dbinom(4, size=6, prob=0.72) + dbinom(3, size=6, prob=0.72), 3)
[1] 0.48
```



**Question 9**

In a particular rural area of Victoria, 80% of learner drivers pass their driving test on the first attempt.

**If 6 learner drivers are selected, what is the probability of a successful driving test outcome for at least 2 drivers?**

[Enter your answer correct to 3 decimal places]

**Answer:** *0.998*

Here it's easier to calculate the probability of none passing, of 1 passing, and then take the complement of this (which includes all outcomes that have 2 or more passing). 

The probability of none passing is

$(1−p)^6$

The probability of exactly 1 passing is

${6 \choose 1}p^1(1−p)^5 = 6p(1−p)^5$

and then subtracting both of these from 1 gives the final answer.

```
> 1 - (dbinom(0, size=6, prob=0.8) + dbinom(1, size=6, prob=0.8))
[1] 0.9984
```



**Question 10**

For a particular rural area, 81% of learner drivers pass their driving test on the first attempt.  Suppose 130 drivers are randomly sampled from the population.

**How many of the drivers would you expect to pass the test on their first attempt?**

[give your answer to the nearest integer]

**Answer:** *105*

We can assume that each of the drivers selected is close enough to independent and that the number of drivers sampled is less than 10% of the population. Also we have $np > 10$ and $nq > 10$.

Therefore to calculate the mean, we can use $np$.

```
> np <- 130 * 0.81
> round(np, 0)
[1] 105
```



**Question 11**

A particular airline arrives on schedule 73% of the time.  Suppose an audit which looks at a random 110 flights is conducted.

**Calculate the standard deviation for the number of on-time flights from samples of 110 audited flights?**

[give your answer to 2 decimal places]

**Answer:** *4.66*

$$
  = \sqrt{npq}\\
  = \sqrt{110 \times 0.73 \times 0.27}\\
  = 4.66
$$

```
> n <- 110
> p <- 0.73
> q <- 1 - p
> round(sqrt(n*p*q), 2)
[1] 4.66
```



**Question 12**

A particular airline arrives on schedule 89% of the time.  Suppose an audit which looks at a random 160 flights is conducted. 

**What is the probability that more than 150 of the flights audited would be on time?
Use a _normal approximation_ to the binomial model.**

[give your answer as a decimal to 3 decimal places, e.g. 0.045]

**Answer:** *0.027*

We can assume that each of the flights is close enough to independent and that the number of audited flights is less than 10% of the population. 

Also we have np > 10 and nq > 10.Therefore to calculate the mean, we can use $np$.

$160 \times 0.89 = 142.4$

Then to calculate the standard deviation, we have $\sqrt{npq}
$$
  \sqrt{npq}\\
  160 \times 0.89 \times 0.11\\
  \approx 3.96\\
$$
Then using a normal model, $N(142.4, 3.96)$ we can work out the probability of having a value greater than 150
$$
  z = \frac{150−142.4}{3.96}\\
  ≈1.92
$$


From a z-table, $P(z<1.92) = 0.9726$ and therefore, since we're looking for the probability of **more** than 150 being on time, we calculate $1 - 0.9726 = 0.027$

```R
> n <- 160
> p <- 0.89
> q <- 1 - p
> sd = sqrt(n*p*q)
> testVal <- 150
> mean <- n * p
> round(1 - pnorm(testVal, mean, sd), 3)
[1] 0.027
```
