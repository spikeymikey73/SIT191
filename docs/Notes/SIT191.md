# Week 1 - Introduction to Data

## 1.1 Introduction

In daily life we are constantly exposed to the results of surveys and experiments. 
Researchers need to gather data to help answer specific questions about the real world.
Natural variation exists in measurements and results. How will we know if reported results represent 'real' differences or are due to chance?

This subject will provide you with a foundation for statistical thinking and methods for collecting, presenting, analysing and interpreting data.

 We start with some basic terminology and properties of data.

## 1.2 Basic Terminology

**Population:** a collection of objects, animals or people whose properties are to be investigated
e.g. all students attending Deakin. The goal is to describe the target population, but this is usually impractical or impossible, so a subset is used.

**Sample:** a subset of a population – ideally it is representative of the target population so valid inferences can be made
e.g. a random selection of Deakin students

**Variable:** a characteristic of a population or sample. e.g. the age of a student

**Data:** the specific observations or values of the variables, e.g 18 yrs & female, 20 yrs & male

**Explanatory variable:** a variable that is being manipulated by the researcher

**Response variable:** a variable whose values are to be compared between treatment groups

**Experiment:** a planned activity that imposes treatments and results in responses to compare

**Observational study:** no manipulation of variables or assignment to treatments - existing records are used

**Parameter:** a numerical characteristic that describes a population. e.g. average age of *all* Deakin students

**Summary statistic:** a numerical characteristic that describes a sample. e.g. average age of *a sample* of Deakin students

**Data matrix:** structure containing the raw data with a row for each person/case and a column for each variable.

**The 5 W’s (Who, What, Where, When, Why) and How**

To provide context for a study, we first should consider the 5 W’s and the How of the data. Note that reported results often do not provide all of these details.

Who: Describes the individuals/objects who/that were surveyed.

What: Determine what exactly is being measured (the variables).

When: When was the research conducted?

Where: Where was the research conducted?

Why: What was the purpose of the survey or experiment?

How: How was the survey or experiment was conducted?



**Who**
The *Who* of the data tells us the individual cases about which (or whom) we have collected data. The people who answer a survey are called respondents. The people taking part in an experiment are called subjects or participants. Animals, plants and inanimate subjects are often called experimental units. Sometimes people just refer to data values as observations and are not clear about the *Who*.

**What
**The *What* means the Variables or characteristics measured and recorded about each individual. The variables are categorical or numerical.

**Why**
*Why* is the experiment or survey being done? The questions asked shape what information we need to collect, and how we treat a variable and the overall results.

**Where, When and How
***When* and *Where* give us information about the context. Was the study conducted 50 years ago or recently? Which country or region does it relate to?

Knowing *How* the data are collected leads to the validity and scope of the conclusions that can be made. The results from a well designed experiment can establish a causal relationship while the results from a small number of voluntary responses to an internet survey will be probably very biased.

## 1.3 Variable Types

### Types of variables

The height of a person and their eye colour are very different types of data. Data are not always numbers! Height is expressed as a number, while eye colour is a word. More formally, height is an example of a *continuous numerical* variable, while eye colour is a *categorical* variable. The variable type determines which numerical and graphical summaries are the most suitable, and which methods are appropriate to use for analysis.

The main variable types are:

- **Categorical,** which can be 

- - ordinal or
  - nominal

- **Numerical***,* which is further classified as:

- - discrete or
  - continuous

### Categorical variables

Examples: gender, ethnicity, favourite football team, postcode

**Categorical (*qualitative*)** refers to naming or classifying things. If words are the data values, then the variable is categorical.

An **ordinal categorical variable** is one where data can be compared as higher or lower on a given scale. There is a natural order to the values, such as "Low", "Medium" and "High".  
Examples include a Four-point Likert Scale (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree) or your final grade (HD, D, C, P, N).

For a **nominal categorical variable** no sensible order to the value exists.  A student's usual mode of transport to school, hair colour or favourite football team are examples of nominal data.    

It is possible for some numerical values to be categorical data if the values have an identifying or labelling function only. For example, mobile phone numbers, post codes or football players’ numbers act to identify rather than measure something and so would be classed as categorical variables. Such information won’t have units, and it would not make sense to calculate the average.

### **Numerical variables**

Examples: weekly income ($), height (cm), weight (kgs), no. of students enrolled

**Numerical (*quantitative*)** variables have data that are numbers with numerical meaning, and units. Examples include people’s height and weight, the number of children in a family and the distance travelled by students to school.

**Discrete** **numerical variables** have no values possible in between successive values, or can be thought of as having a finite number of values between any two given values. For example, the number of pets in a family, or the number of subjects you are enrolled in are discrete variables. The data are often whole numbers but there are exceptions. For example, shoe sizes (6, 6½, 7, 7½, 8 etc.) are not always whole numbers, but there are no values in between successive sizes.

**Continuous** **numerical variables** have, in theory, an infinite number of values possible between any two given values. For example, height and weight are continuous variables, since people are not exactly 165 cm or 178 cm, but could be 165.3 cm or 178.2034 cm. In practice though, measurements are restricted to a certain level of accuracy and so may not *appear* to be continuous.

## 1.4 Relationships Between Variables

**Scatterplots** are a type of graph used to explore a potential relationship between two *numerical* variables.

![img]()![Screen Shot 2015-03-10 at 4.24.27 PM.png](https://d2l.deakin.edu.au/content/enforced/1031733-SIT191_TRI-2_2021/PastedImage_ao5v7sxhtv0waajukzqlopgr3aphp1ff001135065986.png?_&d2lSessionVal=BtpNz3Snt4ayUk6oQ1Btbv6rb&ou=1031733)

### **Explanatory and response variables**

#### Response variable

The variable of interest – the one potentially affected by changes to another variable. The response variable is sometimes called the dependent variable.

#### Explanatory variable

The variable that we use to provide information or a prediction of the response variable. This variable is sometimes called the independent variable.

Choosing the response variable and the explanatory variable depends on how we think about the problem and what we are trying to find.  

> #### Identifying variables
>
> Read section 1.2.4 of the text.
> Identify the explanatory and response variables in each of the following:
>
> 1. Do students who study more get better exam marks?
>
> 2. Can we estimate a person’s BMI from their wrist size?
>
> 3. Do students with higher exam marks get better paid jobs?

Scatterplots have the explanatory variable on the horizontal (x) axis and the response variable on the vertical (y) axis. A scatterplot can display trends, relationships and possible outliers. Even if the two variables appear to be strongly associated, a causal relationship cannot be proven.

When looking at scatterplots, we identify the direction, form (shape), strength and unusual features.

#### Direction

A pattern that runs from the upper left to the lower right is said to have a negative association.

![image-20210714102152443](/Users/malford/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BPscyhSci/SIT191 - Statistics/image-20210714102152443.png)

A trend running the other way has a positive association. High values of one variable are associated with high values of the other.

Sometimes there is no pattern/direction. The variables do not have an association.

#### Form

Relationships can be linear or curved.

![image-20210714102350280](/Users/malford/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BPscyhSci/SIT191 - Statistics/Images/image-20210714102350280.png)







#### Strength

The strength of an association is observed by the amount of scatter the points display.

At one extreme, for a very strong association the points appear to follow a single stream (whether straight or curved).

![image-20210714102421203](/Users/malford/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BPscyhSci/SIT191 - Statistics/Images/image-20210714102421203.png)

At the other extreme, the points appear as a vague cloud with no obvious trend.

![image-20210714102453161](/Users/malford/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BPscyhSci/SIT191 - Statistics/Images/image-20210714102453161.png)





In between, are relationships that display varying amounts of scatter. The interpretation of the strength of a relationship from a graph is subjective and can depend on the scale used.
In Week 10 we study correlation, which is an objective, numerical measure of the strength of a linear association.

#### Unusual features

Look for outliers, clumps or other patterns in the points.
